        The idea that cybernetic politics can be a place for identity play and gender reconstruction is so integral to the scope of understanding the transcendental qualities of identity and form. The trauma of passing off as something other than who you are is carefully illustrated through the character of Karma. A cyborg is a ‘a fictional or hypothetical person whose physical abilities are extended beyond normal human limitations by mechanical elements built into the body’. Mimi Nguyen states that Karma is a cyborg not because of their physical abilities but because of their cultural histories. Karma is a cyborg because they are Vietnamese. Coupled with the general American attitude towards foreign cultures, especially Vietnamese, during the US military industrial complex highlights the exoticism around this character who has endured deep trauma through the course of their life. The sensationalization of their traumas is disturbing and replicant of past and current attitudes towards identities that do not fit into a paradigm of what is considered ‘normal’, or in Karma’s case, at least partially human. The same manner in which Karma is forced to conceal parts of themselves and their multiplicity, unique identities across the world are forced to distill themselves to fit into similar structures. The unprecedented and grave impact of this dilution can create a trauma that is not only personal but also generational.

        What interests us in both the readings is that the dilemmas of stifling identities and sensationalising experiences expressed in one can be carefully treated with systems of language reconfiguration as stated in the other. The performative tendencies of human kind and the identity association based on the superficial can be carefully dissected with ironic linguistic representations. It is the antidote of the celebratory display, the prosthetic social identity and the repressed trauma of not being able to be who you are. At the very least, we can look at the mentioned blasphemy as a tool towards blatantly identifying the distresses of repression. Irony is about humor and serious play. If correctly used, it channels itself as a way to treat serious play respectfully and appropriately but while using humor. It is also a rhetorical strategy and a political method, one that we would like to see more in socialist feminism, as we learn and evolve together.
